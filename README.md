# 🩺 Predicting Diabetes Using Logistic Regression in R

This project involves medical data analysis using R, with a focus on building a logistic regression model to predict the presence of diabetes based on a set of symptoms.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `project.Rmd` or `analysis.R`: Full R code for cleaning, analyzing, and modeling the data
- `report.pdf`: Final report with statistical interpretation
- `data_with_predictions.csv`: The full dataset with predicted outcomes and probabilities
- `images/`: Visualizations and plots (if available)

## 🧪 Methods Used

- 2*2 contingency table analysis
- Chi-square tests for independence
- Risk metrics: π₁, π₂, π₁ − π₂, Relative Risk, Odds Ratio
- Residual and standardized residual analysis
- Logistic regression model
- Prediction on new patients

## 🎯 Objective

To statistically evaluate and predict the likelihood of diabetes using real-world medical data, enhancing understanding of symptom impact and modeling techniques.

## 🛠 Tools

- R programming language
- dplyr, ggplot2, epiR, caret, and base R functions
